# Bone-Marrow-Changes-in-Lumbar-Vertebrae-with-ConvNeXtXLarge-Machine-Learning-


In this project, the ConvNeXt-XLarge architecture was employed for feature extraction. Various classification algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),Support Vector Machine (SVM),  Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting (HGB), AdaBoost (AdaB), Passive Aggressive (PA), and Logistic Regression (LG), were utilized to evaluate classification performance.

The primary objective of this study is to develop a deep learning-based model capable of accurately distinguishing Normal and Abnormal MRI scans of the lumbar vertebrae, specifically identifying Bone Marrow Changes in Lumbar Vertebrae (BMCLVB). The model is trained on a labeled dataset, enabling it to recognize distinct patterns and features linked to these changes.

To enhance classification accuracy, the dataset was categorized into two broad groups—Normal and Abnormal—based on the affected regions. Additionally, each class was further subdivided into more specific categories. The project also explores the integration of transfer learning to improve the classification performance of BMCLVB, leveraging pre-trained deep learning models for better feature extraction and generalization.
